# 🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classification | Deep Learning Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This deep learning project classifies images of cats and dogs using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and optimized using various techniques to achieve high accuracy.

## 🚀 Features
- CNN-based deep learning model for binary image classification
- Data augmentation for better generalization
- Regularization (Dropout & Batch Normalization) to reduce overfitting
- Transfer learning (optional) for improved performance
- Optimized with **Adam optimizer** and **learning rate scheduling**

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images of cats and dogs. You can download the dataset from:
- **[Kaggle: Dogs vs. Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)**
- Or use your own dataset with the same structure.

## 📜 Model Architecture
The CNN architecture includes:
- Multiple **Conv2D** layers with **ReLU activation**
- **MaxPooling2D** layers for feature reduction
- **Batch Normalization** for stable training
- Fully connected **Dense layers** with dropout
- **Sigmoid activation** for binary classification

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
